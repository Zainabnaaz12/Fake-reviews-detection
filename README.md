# 🕵️‍♀️ Fake Review Detection using NLP and Machine Learning

This project identifies fake product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. It analyzes the review's sentiment, structure, and patterns to classify it as genuine or fake.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Online platforms are filled with user reviews, many of which can be fake and misleading. The goal of this project is to build a system that flags potentially fake reviews using advanced text analysis techniques.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- BERT (transformers)
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Pandas, NumPy
- Streamlit (for local UI)

## 📁 Dataset
- Product review dataset (sample scraped or sourced from public data)
- Preprocessed for NLP tasks such as tokenization, vectorization, and sentiment tagging

## 📈 Model Performance
- Accuracy: 90% (best model: Logistic Regression with BERT features)
- Evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix
